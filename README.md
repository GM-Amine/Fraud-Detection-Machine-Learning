# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to build and evaluate classification models capable of identifying fraud within highly imbalanced financial data.

## Methodology
The analysis includes:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Handling class imbalance
- Feature analysis
- Training and evaluation of classification models
- Performance assessment using appropriate metrics

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science and machine learning libraries

## Files
- `Credit_Fraud.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and modeling process
